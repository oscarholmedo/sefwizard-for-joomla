# SEF Wizard plugin for Joomla 3.x
This plugin removes IDs from the URL of standard Joomla components, such as com_content, com_contact and com_tags. 
Moreover, you can handle page duplicates by setting 301 redirects to canonical pages or 
by throwing a 404 error. Simple, lightweight and reliable, SEF Wizard will make your URLs without IDs and 
duplicates.
