# SEF Wizard plugin for Joomla 3.x
If you are using Joomla! 3.x and looking for a way how to remove IDs from URL, consider using 
our free plugin SEF Wizard. This plugin removes IDs from the URL of standard Joomla components, 
such as com_content, com_contact and com_tags. Moreover, you can handle page duplicates by setting 
301 redirects to canonical pages or by throwing a 404 error. Simple, lightweight and reliable, 
SEF Wizard will make your URLs without IDs and duplicates. You do not have to buy heavy and expensive 
SEF plugins anymore for such a simple task.
