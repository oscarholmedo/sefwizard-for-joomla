# SEF Wizard plugin for Joomla 3.x/2.5.x
SEF Wizard for Joomla! removes IDs from the URL of standard Joomla components, such as com content, 
com contact and com tags. Moreover, you can handle page duplicates by setting 301 redirects to canonical 
pages or by throwing a 404 error. Simple, lightweight and reliable, SEF Wizard will make your URLs 
without IDs and duplicates. You do not have to buy heavy and expensive SEF plugins anymore for such 
a simple task.
